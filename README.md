## D-Lab workshop in Linguistics department

This workshop will give researchers the skills required to perform data-driven research in the Python scientific ecosystem.

The workshop will take place in 1229 Dwinelle from 3:30pm-5pm on the four Wednesdays of September (6th, 13th, 20th, and 27th). The workshop will consist of replicating data-intensive papers, but the focus is on participants becoming confident in data munging and data analysis in Python. We'll be replicating Futrell et al (2016) on Piraha syntax and Hay & Bauer (2007) on phonemic inventories and population size. There is no expectation that participants will have read these papers. All are welcome, but we will begin assuming people have some familiarity with these topics in any programming language. "Familiarity" includes having only done those things once; we will spend a good amount of time making sure we really understand how these topics work, and when we would want to use them.
