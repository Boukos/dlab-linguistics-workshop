    "# Pirahã syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we are going to explore Pirahã syntax. As you know, Pirahã is (in)famous in the field of linguistics for many reasons. One of the most prominent claims made about the language is a lack of syntactic recursion. Futrell et al. (2016) analyze a corpus of Pirahã for evidence of syntactic embedding. They report that they do not find any such evidence, and that the corpus is consistent with an analysis of Pirahã as a regular language. If you want to know more about Pirahã and the controversy surrounding it, read the following:\n",

    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The corpus used in the paper consists of Pirahã stories that were originally collected and translated by Steve Sheldon and Dan Everett over the period of several decades. It also includes aligned translation between Pirahã\n",
    "and English, including shallow syntactic parses and approximate English glosses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the authors describe the way they created the corpus:\n",
    "> We obtained glossed transcriptions of 17 stories in Pirahã, consisting of a total of 1149 sentences\n",
    "and 6830 words in our analysis. 13 of the stories were collected by Steve Sheldon in the\n",
    "1970s, and the remaining 4 stories were collected by Dan Everett over the period 1980–2009.\n",
    "Each story was told by a single speaker with no recorded interruptions. The stories were transcribed\n",
    "by Everett or Sheldon; audio recordings are only available for stories 2 and 3. According\n",
    "to Everett, the texts are fairly representative of how the Pirahã tell stories to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're interested, you can see all the original texts in pdf format [here](https://github.com/languageMIT/piraha/tree/master/sources)."

    "### Structure of the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it's great that the data is made freely available, it's in a really messy format. It's going to take some preprocessing for us to reformat the data into a more usable form. Here's the description from the [README](https://github.com/languageMIT/piraha/blob/master/README.md) of how the corpus is structured:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Each text in the corpus is preceded by three lines of hashes and information about the source of the text. The corpus is divided into stories; stories are divided into \"utterances\"; and utterances are divided into sentences. Utterances correspond to the sentence breaks in Steve Sheldon's original glosses. Each utterance is preceded by two English glosses (free translations). The first is labeled with a hash and a code of two numbers, and reflects the English translation given by Steve Sheldon or Daniel L. Everett in their original translation. The second is labeled with a hash and a code of three numbers, and reflects the current best translation, as judged by Daniel L. Everett, Steve Sheldon, and the other authors. Clarifications are provided in square brackets in these glosses. The glosses allow simple text searching to find rough equivalents of English words and phrases (e.g. what does Pirahã use to convey meanings glossed as \"and\"?).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Each Pirahã sentence is labeled with a unique code of three numbers, appearing on the preceding line along with its current best English translation. The first number indicates the text in which the utterance appears. The second number indicates the utterance's sequential placement within the text. This second number reflects the utterance boundaries present in the original transcriptions (e.g. by Dan Everett and Steve Sheldon). In many cases, text which was originally translated into a single utterance actually includes a group of Pirahã sentences according to our current best translations. When this occurs, the third number indicates the order of the Pirahã sentences within this grouping. Otherwise, the third number is simply 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's my simplification of it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The corpus is all in one file, `piraha.txt`.\n",
    "- There are 17 stories in the corpus. They are separated from one another by three lines of hashtags.\n",
    "- Each story starts with three pieces of metadata: the source, the informant and the comment.\n",
    "- The source holds the names of the original pdf files of the story and the story number.\n",
    "- The informant is the speaker (for most stories there's only one speaker).\n",
    "- The comment holds various other things, like background, summary of the story, etc.\n",
    "- After the metadata, each story has a series of utterances. Utterances are the original sentence boundaries given by either Everett or Sheldon. Each utterance has a number within the story (e.g. 4.16 for utterance number 16 in story number 4). Immediately after the numeric identifier comes the original English translation of the utterance.\n",
    "- However, Sheldon and Everett have re-analyzed many utterances to in fact consist of more than one sentence. So each utterance actually consists of one or more sentences. Each sentence is identified by the story number, utterance number and sentence number (so 4.16.2 is the 2nd sentence of the 16th utterance of the 4th text). Immediately after each numeric identifier of a sentence is a shallow parse tree.\n",

      "\n",
      "Steve Sheldon early 1970s; Translations and glosses completed by Dan Everett 2009. This is a story about a small baby (Tixohóí) who during the night falls off the bed and near the fire. His mother (Kato) and father (Hoagaixoóxai) are sound sleepers and do not waken to his crying. The grandmother (Xaogoíso) who is telling the story is very angry as is her sister (Xigaoxixaihoái) and husband (Xopísi). The father’s brother (Xoii) is also angry at their sleepiness and threatens that because the mother is such a sound sleeper he will have sexual contact with her some night and she would never know it. The baby is not really burned nor hurt, and finally grandmother takes baby back to his mommy to be nursed and put back to sleep. When the baby is sleeping again, the grandmother also returns to sleep.\n",
